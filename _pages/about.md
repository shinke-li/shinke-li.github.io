Hi! I am a Post-doc research fellow in the Faculty of Engineering at the National University of Singapore (NUS). Before that, I was a Ph.D. student in NUS supervised by [Prof. Chee Yeow Meng](https://www.nus.edu.sg/about/management/chee-yeow-meng). My thesis topic was "Towards Dataset Construction for 3D Understanding". I received an M. Sc (Electrical & Computer Engineering) degree from NUS. I was also hired as a research assistant at IORA, NUS, working on several innovative projects of deep learning visual applications. Besides the vision-based projects, I am also interested in implementing machine learning techniques in medical applications. My research work was published in distinguished conferences, including CVPR, ICCV, NeurIPS, ACM MM, and AAAI.

My Current Research Topics:
* Deep Learning on 3D Point Cloud
* Data-centric and Reliable AI
