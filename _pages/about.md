Hi! I am a forth-year PhD student in Faculty of Engineering at National University of Singapore (NUS), supervised by [Prof. Chee Yeow Meng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=99AJNXEAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). My research interests lie on Deep Learning, 3D Point Cloud, and Graph Neural Network. I received M. Sc (Electrical & Computer Engineering) from NUS. I was also hired as a research assistant at IORA, NUS, working on serveral innovative projects of deep learning applications. Besides the computer vision projects, I have also interested in the implementation of machine learning techiniques on medical applications.
Research Topics:
* Deep Learning on 3D Point Cloud
* Graph Neural Network
* Data-centric and Robust AI
